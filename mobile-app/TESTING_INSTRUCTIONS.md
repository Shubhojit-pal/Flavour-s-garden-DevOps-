# 📱 SIMPLE TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

## Good News! ✅ 
Your mobile app Expo server **IS RUNNING**! 

## Two Ways to Test:

---

### Option 1: Find the QR Code (Recommended for Phone Testing)

**Look for a PowerShell/Terminal window that shows:**
- Black and white squares (████ ▀▀▀ blocks) - this is the QR code!
- Text: "Metro waiting on exp://..."
- Text: "Scan the QR code above with Expo Go"

**Where is it?**
- Check your taskbar at the bottom of Windows
- Look for a terminal window you opened 5-10 minutes ago
- It's separate from your main development terminal

**Once you find it:**
1. Download "Expo Go" app on your phone
2. iPhone: Open Camera → Point at QR code → Tap notification
3. Android: Open Expo Go → "Scan QR Code" → Point at QR code

### Option 2: Open App Manually in Browser (Easier!)

**Just click this link:**
→ http://localhost:19006

OR

**Type in your browser's address bar:**
```
http://localhost:19006
```

This should open the mobile app in your web browser!

**If that doesn't work, try:**
```
http://localhost:8081
```

---

## Then Test Login:

Once the app loads (phone or browser), try:

**User Login:**
```
Email: john.doe@example.com
Password: password123
```

**Admin Login:**
```
Email: jane.smith@example.com
Password: password123
```
